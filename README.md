# Deploy, Build, and Test Workflow with GitHub Actions

This guide demonstrates how to set up a workflow for deploying, building, and testing your project using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

In this demo, we'll create a workflow that automates the process of deploying your code, building your project, and running tests.

## Steps

1. **Use GitHub Marketplace Workflow Template**
   - Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository 
   - Search for and select an appropriate workflow template from the GitHub Marketplace
   - This template will help you set up the initial structure for logging into your repository

2. **Create Secrets**
   - Set up secrets in both Azure and the GitHub repository's "Secrets" section
   - These secrets will securely store sensitive information like access tokens or credentials

3. **Configure Workflow**
   - In your workflow file, add a step to check out your code
```
 steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
   - Ensure the workflow is configured to run on your main branch
```
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```
   - This step is crucial for accessing your project files during the workflow execution

## Important Notes

- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create workflows and secrets in your repository
- Always keep your secrets and sensitive information secure
- Customize the workflow as needed to fit your specific project requirements
- Regularly review and update your workflow to ensure it remains effective and secure

By following these steps, you'll have a basic workflow set up to automate your deploy, build, and test processes using GitHub Actions.
